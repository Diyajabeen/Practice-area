CI=continuos integration
Whenever developers push code to github,the code is automatically tested and merged.
Benefits:
Detect bugs early,makes team wrk easier,ensure the code base always works
CD=continuos deployment/Delivery
After code passes test,it's automtically send to production
Benefits:
Faster release,less manual effort,safer updates
it helps automated;
Testing,Building,Deploying your code every time you make changes


Why is it important?
Catch bugs early
Speed up deployment
Make teame collaboration smoother
Reduce human errors
Ensure code quality
Reliable and consistent releases

What tools are used?
Github Actions
Jenkins
Gitlab
CircleCI(cloud based)
Docker(packages your app into container)+kubernetes(deploys and manages these containers)[for deployment]
TravisCI


Real world eg were CI/CD is used
Instagram
Use case:Adding a new feature to instagram chat
imagine instagram want to release a new "voice note" feature in DMs

CI/CD actions:
step1:Developer pushs code
write the code for the voice note and pushes into the github
step2:CI pipeline runs
Github actions does this automatically:
.Checks the new code for bugs
.Ensure it doesnt break existing code
.Runs security scans and formating checks
if test pass code is approved
if not developer is notify to fix issues
step3:CD pipeline starts
once the code is ready:
its automatically built into an app package
its deployed to a staging server where testers try it out
if all goes well,its deployed to production for users via:
.google play store
.app store
.web app server
